Reading is one of those habits that feels simple, but can be hard to keep up with. Between busy schedules, endless distractions, and the growing list of “to be read” titles, it’s easy to lose track. That’s where a **book tracking app** can make all the difference.  

Instead of messy spreadsheets or forgotten notes, everything lives in one place on your phone. A tracker helps you see what you’ve read, set goals, and stay motivated.

## What Is a Book Tracking App?

A **book tracker** is a tool designed for readers to:

- Log finished books  
- Track progress while reading  
- Set yearly or monthly goals  
- Organize books into shelves or collections  
- Save notes, highlights, and favorite quotes  

It’s like having a personal reading journal, but digital, fast, and always with you.

## Why Tracking Books Matters

Readers often run into the same problems:

- Forgetting titles and authors  
- Struggling to stay consistent  
- Losing interesting quotes or ideas  
- Not knowing what to read next  

A tracker solves this by making your reading visible. You see your progress, your stats, and your achievements — and that’s motivating.
