We're thrilled to announce the biggest update to Bookie yet! Bookie 2.0.0 is more than just a version bump; it's a complete reimagining of your favorite book tracker. We've been listening to your feedback, squashing bugs, and building the features you've been asking for. This release is packed with a stunning new design, powerful new functionality, and countless refinements to make your reading life more organized and beautiful.

Let's dive in!


## A Stunning New Look: Liquid Glass

With the latest **iOS 26**, we're introducing a breathtaking **Liquid Glass** design. This new aesthetic brings a translucent, layered look to Bookie making the entire app feel lighter and more integrated with your device. Itâ€™s a modern, clean interface that puts your book covers front and center.

Don't worry, we believe in supporting our whole community! We've worked hard to ensure Bookie still looks fantastic on older operating systems. While we now support iOS 26, our base requirement is still iOS 17, meaning we support devices going back three years. You'll get a polished, seamless experience no matter which device you're on.


## Find Anything Instantly: Unified Search

We've supercharged search in Bookie 2.0. The new, dedicated **Search tab** is your one-stop shop for finding anything across the app. Whether you're looking for a book you discovered, a specific note you jotted down, an author, or a favorite quote, you can now find it all from a single, powerful search bar. This streamlines your workflow and makes accessing your information faster than ever.


## Make It Yours: All-New Themes

We heard you loud and clear: not everyone is a fan of the classic Bookie orange! Personalization is key to feeling at home in an app you use every day. That's why we're so excited to introduce **Themes**.

This premium feature lets you completely change Bookie's color palette to match your style. We've created a cohesive pack of beautiful themes, including:
- **Slate**: A sophisticated dark gray.
- **Mint**: A fresh and clean light green.
- **Dracula**: For all the true dark mode fans.
- **All-Black**: A sleek, OLED-friendly option.
- **Pink**: A vibrant and fun new addition!

Themes are a great way to make Bookie truly yours while supporting the app's future development.


## Under the Hood: A Mountain of Fixes & Refinements

This update isn't just about looks; it's also about performance, stability, and improving the little things that make a big difference.

1. **Massive Bug Squashing**: We performed a major refactor of our Notes system, fixing a critical crash that occurred when deleting a note from the middle of a list. We also fixed the annoying bug where the home view wouldn't refresh, and now a simple pull-to-refresh works as expected!
2. **An Improved Experience**: You can now swipe on notes in your list to quickly delete, duplicate, or edit them. We've also fixed issues where UI elements like the "love" button on a book's detail page wouldn't update correctly.
3. **Performance Boost**: We've refactored major components like the Challenge and Activity views, getting rid of old code and making everything faster and more reliable.
4. **Widget Fixes**: Your home screen widgets are back and better than ever! They are now properly linked to the app and will sync with your chosen theme and cached book covers.
5. **Translations**: We've filled in many missing translations to improve the experience for our international users.
6. **Shake to Read**: We fixed a crash associated with the Shake to Read feature and added a helpful dialog that appears if you try to use it while it's disabled in settings.

This is just the tip of the iceberg. From small UI tweaks like improved button styles and better iPad support to fixing the "Manage Subscription" button, we've touched nearly every part of the app to make it better.

Thank you for being part of the Bookie community. Your feedback is what drives us to keep improving. We can't wait for you to try Bookie 2.0.0!
