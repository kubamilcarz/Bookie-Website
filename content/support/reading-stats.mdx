  We'll break down every card inside the stats tab, how often metrics refresh, and which ones sync across devices.

## Reading streak

Bookie increments your streak whenever you log reading activity on a given day.

<StepList>
  <li>Log a reading session manually or with the timer.</li>
  <li>Ensure the session has at least one minute of progress.</li>
  <li>Sync to iCloud so other devices see the same streak.</li>
</StepList>

<QuickTip>
  Missed a day? You can’t edit streak history, but Bookie will highlight “restart streak” to keep you motivated.
</QuickTip>

## Time spent & pace

The time graph aggregates the past 30 days of reading. Tap any bar to reveal the titles included that day.
