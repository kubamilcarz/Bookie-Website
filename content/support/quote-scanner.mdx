## Pro tips for crisp scans

<QuickTip>
  Find indirect light and keep your phone parallel to the page—glare and angles cause most OCR mistakes.
</QuickTip>

- Use a neutral surface behind curved pages.
- Tap to focus on glossy covers before scanning.
- Toggle the flash in low light (button in the top left).

<Callout type="warning" title="Still blurry?">
  If the preview text looks soft, wipe your camera lens and move 15–20cm away from the paper so the lens can
  focus properly.
</Callout>

## Next steps

Once saved, quotes live alongside reading stats, so you can revisit them later or share a branded graphic on social.
From the quote detail screen you can:

- Add a reflection note
- Export to PDF or Markdown
- Share straight to Instagram Stories
