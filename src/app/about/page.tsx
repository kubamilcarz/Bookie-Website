            Hi, Iâ€™m Kuba ðŸ‘‹
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8 text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
            The idea for Bookie grew on me over the course of a year. I wanted
            reading to feel encouraging, not like a chore. Other apps felt
            cluttered and uninspiringâ€”I wanted a place where I could set myself
            little challenges, track my books in a way that felt motivating, and
            enjoy it all inside a clean, elegant design.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8 text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
            Work on Bookie started in October 2022, and by December the first
            version was ready. It was actually my second app, and the one where
            I put everything I had learned so far as a developer. When it
            launched, readers noticed the polish and care that went into it.
          </p>

          <p className="mt-8 text-base text-neutral-700 leading-relaxed text-left">
            Since then, Bookie has kept evolvingâ€”adding fantastic new features,
            refining the experience, and even introducing Bookie+ for those
            power users who want more. At its heart though, Bookie is still
            about the same thing: helping people turn reading into a daily habit
            they love. One page at a time.
          </p>
